PDF Automation Toolbox (Tkinter GUI)
====================================

This is a cross-platform desktop application built with **Python + Tkinter**
for common PDF operations: merging, splitting, extracting text, watermarking,
converting images to PDF, and viewing metadata.

The codebase is organized according to `requirements.md`.

Basic usage
----------

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Notes
-----

- The initial version only wires up the GUI skeleton and stub logic modules.
- You can iteratively enhance each operation module in `pdf_toolbox/` to add
  more advanced behaviors.
